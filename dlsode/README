Instructions [from Rodrigo]

1) unpack tar file
2) issue "gfortran -c opk*.f" -> compiles source into object files
3) then "ar -r opk.a opk*.o"  -> creates library opk.a (could have another 
name)
4) finally "gfortran -o main.bin main.f opk.a" -> compiles main program 
using library

Anytime you want to use the library, just add it at the end of the 
compilation line (you must use the same compiler and architecture, 
otherwise will need to recompile).

All the additional options (which are plenty) are detailed in the 
preamble of opkdmain.f
