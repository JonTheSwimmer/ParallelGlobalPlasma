This code is used to propagate photons from an emission structure through a Monte Carlo Simulation. Processing code is then used to determine equilibrium pair plasma densities in the magnetosphere.

To use:
    In the example_process folder, the parameters file is used to determine the size of the emission structure. 
    There are sample job scripts that show how to run the MC sim (photonRun.sh),
        as well as process the resulting photon data (processRun.sh)
